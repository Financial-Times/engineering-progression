## Overview

This repository aims to be the one source of truth for engineering careers and progression in the CTO organisation of the Financial Times. The data in this repo can have changes made to it via pull requests and GitHub issues, our intention is to have conversations around our career paths in the same place as we talk about our day-to-day work.

We also intend on these career competencies being made available in other familiar formats, for example a generated Google Sheet which managers and reports can use to track progress.


## Engineering Competencies

Engineering competencies are used to help identify when an engineer is ready for promotion. There are several ways that you can read through these competencies and track progress:

  - [Track progress with your manager or report via Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V0LIbCQtJsi2iowfJnRTDr4Na4LhNAlJ_UHl9dDQs00/edit)

  - [Read the engineering competencies as YAML in this repository](data/competencies.yml)


## Contributing

Anybody working for the Financial Times is welcome to suggest changes via a GitHub issue or pull request. We maintain a [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to help people who are interested. There are many different ways you can contribute and help make this resource better for everyone:

  - **Contribute to the Engineering Competencies**<br/>
The Engineering competencies are used to help identify when an engineer is ready for promotion. Every engineer in the CTO organisation of the Financial Times can help shape these competencies. While they are in alpha and beta we are especially interested in contributions.  [A guide for adding or editing competencies is here](docs/competencies.md).

  - **Contribute to the documentation and website**<br/>
    It's important that the documentation in this repo and the Engineering Progression website are clear and easy to understand. [Get started maintaining the documentation](docs/documentation.md)

  - **Build your own integration**<br/>
    The competencies data is available through a JSON API, which means that engineers at the Financial Times can build their own integrations on top of it. [Get started writing your own integrations](docs/integrations.md)

  - **Contribute to the running of this repository**<br/>
    This repository is the one source of truth for engineering careers and progression, and as such it's important that the code is maintained. It's also important that issues and pull requests are responded to quickly. [Get started contributing to the running of this repo](docs/repository.md)
