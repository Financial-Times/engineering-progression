This could be through additional official responsibilities such as line managing or tech leading, or through unofficial means such as mentoring or regular pairing. S1 engineers should be able to tackle more complicated technical problems, and explain and justify their approaches to their team. We expect S1 engineers to pick up work outside of their delivery team and manage that work effectively against their delivery teamâ€™s priorities. S1 engineers require very little oversight beyond high level direction.\n"

This influence could be through tech leading, line managing, mentoring, or leading projects outside of their day-to-day work. Senior 2 engineers are good at seeing ill defined or difficult projects through to completion. They are great at spotting issues and helping their team navigate them. Senior 2 engineers are seen as the go-to person for a particular technology or product.\n"
