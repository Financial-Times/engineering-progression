# Contributing: Integrations

The competencies data is available through a JSON API, which means that engineers at the Financial Times can build their own integrations on top of it. This guide is for those people.

  - [Using the API](#using-the-api)
  - [Adding Integrations](#adding-integrations)


## Using the API

The API is documented on the [Engineering Progression website](https://engineering-progression.ft.com), and is free to use by people at the Financial Times. We have published the data in this format to make it as portable as possible, and you're encouraged to generate your own alternative formats based on it.

If you would like your integration to be automatically notified when the engineering competencies are updated, then please open an issue on this repo asking for it â€“ somebody will be happy to add a GitHub Webhook which pings your integration.


## Adding Integrations

If you think your integration would be useful to other teams within the FT, we'll consider bringing it into this repository. Open an issue with a proposal and we'll discuss it.
