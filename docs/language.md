# Contributing: Tone and Language

The documentation, website, and competencies all follow the guidelines outlined in this document. This guide is for anybody who wants to make changes to these resources that other people will have to read later.

TODO:

  - Add the competencies guide that Alice and Mark put together
  - Add some general guidelines. I recommend taking the [new Origami guidelines](https://origami-test.ft.com/docs/principles/tone-and-language/) as a starting point
