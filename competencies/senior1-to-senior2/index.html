		<p>The Senior 2 (S2) engineer exhibits leadership and influence well beyond themselves. This influence could be through tech leading, line managing, mentoring, or leading projects outside of their day-to-day work. Senior 2 engineers are good at seeing ill-defined or difficult projects through to completion. They are great at spotting issues and helping their team navigate them. Senior 2 engineers have a deep understanding and willingness to help others for a particular technology or product.
