	<h2>Mid to Senior 1</h2>
	<p>S1 engineers are expected to improve the performance of those around them. This could be through additional official responsibilities such as line managing or tech leading, or through unofficial means such as mentoring or regular pairing. S1 engineers should be able to tackle more complicated technical problems, and explain and justify their approaches to their team. We expect S1 engineers to pick up work outside of their delivery team and manage that work effectively against their delivery team’s priorities.
