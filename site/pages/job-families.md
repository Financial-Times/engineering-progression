# {{page.title}}

In FT Technology we have several job families, which describe the different roles and available and suggest career paths that our staff members might choose to follow. 

## Engineering

Engineers at early stages are Individual Contributors (hands-on), and later have the option to pursue a People Management role or track. Engineers can switch tracks, but must demonstrate the competencies and experience necessary for a role. These are described in a combination of a Job Description for a particular role, and the [Competencies](/competencies/) for that role.

Senior 2 and Principal roles split into either Engineering Manager or Individual Contributor tracks. The Tech Director and CTO roles are after Principal Engineer in the Engineering Manager track.](/media/engineering-roles.png)
