# {{page.title}}

The engineering competencies have been planned, written and rolled out by a working group consisting of engineers from across Product &amp; Technology. This page documents some of the group's processes, if you're interested in joining then please [contact the Working Group](#contact).

You can check the [current Working Group members on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Financial-Times/teams/engineering-progression-working-group/members).


## Process

Now that the competencies have stabilised, the Working Group meets once a week. We discuss any issues that have been opened since the last meeting, as well as planning future work. Tasks are assigned to individuals on a voluntary basis.

[The agenda for this meeting is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o2MfeMZjovFva-0BwSbm2UN_06HxxbhWfKPugmkNO1Q/edit) (only accessible to Working Group members).

Outside of this weekly meeting, members do any work they can fit around their normal schedule.
