# {{page.title}}

The engineering competencies have been planned, written and rolled out by a working group consisting of engineers from across Product &amp; Technology. This page documents some of the group's processes, if you're interested in joining then please [contact the Working Group](#contact).

You can check the [current Working Group members on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Financial-Times/teams/engineering-progression-working-group/members).


## Responsibilities

Members of the working group are responsible for:

  * Answering questions about the competency framework
  * Coordinating changes to the competencies, and making sure they meet the [language guidelines](https://github.com/Financial-Times/engineering-progression/blob/master/docs/language.md)
  * Communicating competency changes to all engineers who use the framework
  * Working with PTE and TLG if their input is needed on a task
  * Maintaining the competency framework [repo](https://github.com/orgs/Financial-Times/engineering-progression) and [website](https://engineering-progression.ft.com/), including reviewing pull requests and responding to issues


## Process

The Working Group meets once every two weeks, and we work to this agenda. If tasks are assigned to individuals then it's on a voluntary basis, and non-critical tasks don't have deadlines. This allows Working Group members to pick things up when it can fit around their regular work.

We follow an agenda for these meetings, make notes, and assign actions in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GHtXdANM6Yq6Xwh_6lHi3mTY-BtRF-0iPcTWFhfAnL4/edit).
