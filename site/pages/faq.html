## Is there an individual contributor route?

There is no separate individual contributor route to promotion, but the aim is
to have a single set of competencies that are flexible enough to allow for a
variety of ways that an engineer can demonstrate seniority.

A key idea here is that the more senior you are as an engineer, the more you
should be helping those around you to achieve. There are many ways to do
this:
- Line managing
- Mentoring
- Directing the work of a team ("tech leading")
- Reviewing and driving up the quality in others' technical output
- Influencing technical communities and decisions across the organisation

Choosing not to pursue line management will mean you need to demonstrate
that you are having a positive impact on others' work in other ways.

## There are no competencies for Principal Engineer. Why is this?

The Product & Technology Executive/Technology Leadership Group made a decision
in 2018: Principal roles and beyond must have a position open and advertised.
The promotions board therefore plays no role in deciding who becomes a
Principal Engineer, so there are no competencies defined at this stage. The
recruiting manager for each Principal Engineer role defines what the criteria
for that role will be.

There is no specific cap on the number of Principals; it is governed by open roles
and decisions about the organisationâ€™s structure. To advance to Principal Engineer
either a position needs to become vacant, or a new Principal Engineer role must be 
created, typically when forming a new team, significantly expanding an existing one, 
or some other significant change occurs in a technology group's circumstances.

Post Beta, we do aim to include competencies for Principal Engineers within
the FT engineering competencies, to act as a guide for recruiting managers and
existing Senior 2 Engineers.
