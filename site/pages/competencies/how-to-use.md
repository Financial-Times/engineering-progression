# {{page.title}}

Engineering competencies are used to help identify when an engineer is ready for promotion. We divide competencies into levels.

## Levels

Each level represents the work needed to be promoted from one role into another, so the name of each level contains two different job titles:

<ul>
{% for level in site.data.levels %}
	<li>{{level.name}}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

So, for example, a Junior Engineer should be working towards the competencies at the "Junior to Mid" level.

## Competencies

Each competency has a summary which is designed to prompt a yes/no response. For each competency, an engineer should feel able to answer either _"yes, I'm meeting this competency"_, or _"no, I'm not meeting this competency yet"_.

Engineers are expected to meet all of the competencies for a level in order to be promoted, _except_ for domain-specific competencies that don't apply to their role or specialism.

### Domain-specific competencies

Some competencies are domain-specific. This means that the competency is only applicable if an engineer is working in a specific domain. For example, an engineer who builds web pages is expected to know about web accessibility, but we wouldn't expect the same of an engineer who works in operations.

### Examples

Some competencies have one or more examples. The examples are purely illustrative, and will not apply to everyone. When working towards a competency, an engineer does not need to be meeting any of the examples given if they can provide evidence that they are meeting the competency in another way.

### Evidence

Engineers are expected to provide evidence that they are are meeting a competency when it comes to writing a promotions case. We expect a sentence or two, and an engineer's line manager should be ready to provide further detail if necessary. A copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V0LIbCQtJsi2iowfJnRTDr4Na4LhNAlJ_UHl9dDQs00/edit" class="o-typography-link--external">Engineering Progression Tracker (Google Sheet)</a> is useful for keeping track of progress.
