# {{page.title}}

The engineering competencies have been planned, written and rolled out by a working group consisting of the following people:

- [Alice Bartlett](https://people-finder.in.ft.com/search?name=Alice%20Bartlett) - Principal Engineer, Customer Products
- [Mark Barnes](https://people-finder.in.ft.com/search?name=mark%20barnes) - Technical Officer, Foundation Services
- [Laura Carvajal](https://people-finder.in.ft.com/search?name=laura%20carvajal) - Principal Engineer, Internal Products
- [Rowan Manning](https://people-finder.in.ft.com/search?name=Rowan%20Manning) - Principal Engineer, Origami
- [Rhys Evans](https://people-finder.in.ft.com/search?name=rhys%20evans) - Principal Engineer, Reliability Engineering
- [Tom Kennedy](https://people-finder.in.ft.com/search?name=Tom%20Kennedy) - Project Support Administrator


We are all Principal Engineers (or equivalent), are all based in London and are more representative of web + nodejs teams at the FT than other disciplines (though we have tried to be conscious of our biases when writing the competencies).

For the next stage in the competencies' evolution we'd like to gradually hand over to a more representative set of people
- A mix of seniority
- Representation from Sofia and Manila
- A more diverse mix of backgrounds

So, we would like to invite anyone within FT tech to join the group, and help us continue to iterate on the competencies and other aspects of career progression within engineering.

## Job description

### Time commitment
At present the commitment is one hour-long meeting per week, with a variable amount of time (never more than a few hours, and frequently zero) spent on tasks outside those meetings. We anticipate that, in the long term, the time commitment will decrease, although it may temporarily go up following the first proper use of the competencies in September 2019.

### Duties
- Review, discuss and respond to issues and pull requests raised by engineers at the FT
- Contribute to writing and coordinating communications to FT tech. This can involve
  - writing paragraphs for the Tech Director (JK) and Chief Product & Information Officer (Cait) newsletters
  - updating information on the website
  - writing blog posts on the FT product and tech medium
- Helping to run workshops to gather feedback from engineers (we expect less of this from now on, but it may be the case that we need to in order to gather more feedback as we refine the competencies)
- (Optional) Iterate on the methods we have for presenting and interacting with the competencies (e.g currently we have this website, a spreadsheet and an API, but more tools could be created)
