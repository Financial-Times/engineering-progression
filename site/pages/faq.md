## Is there an individual contributor route?

There is no separate individual contributor route for progression, but the aim
is to have a single set of competencies that are flexible enough to allow for
a variety of ways that an engineer can demonstrate seniority.

A key idea here is that the more senior you are as an engineer, the more you
should be helping those around you to achieve. There are many ways to do
this:
- Line managing
- Mentoring
- Directing the work of a team ("tech leading")
- Reviewing and driving up the quality in others' technical output
- Influencing technical communities and decisions across the organisation

Choosing not to pursue line management will mean you need to demonstrate
that you are having a positive impact on others' work in other ways.

## There are no competencies for Principal Engineer. Why is this?

The Product & Technology Executive/Technology Leadership Group made a decision
in 2018: Principal roles and beyond must have a position open and advertised. The
recruiting manager for each Principal Engineer role defines what the criteria
for that role will be.

There is no specific cap on the number of Principals; it is governed by open roles
and decisions about the organisationâ€™s structure. To advance to Principal Engineer
either a position needs to become vacant, or a new Principal Engineer role must be
created, typically when forming a new team, significantly expanding an existing one,
or some other significant change occurs in a technology group's circumstances.

Post Beta, we do aim to include competencies for Principal Engineers within
the FT engineering competencies, to act as a guide for recruiting managers and
existing Senior 2 Engineers.

## Do I need to meet competencies from earlier levels?

Yes. For example we expect our Senior 2 Engineers to still be exhibiting the competencies from the "Mid to Senior 1" level as well as the "Senior 1 to Senior 2" level.

Assuming that competencies from earlier levels are met means that we do not need to duplicate competencies across different levels.

This is covered in the ["how to use the competencies" guide](/competencies/how-to-use/).

## Do I need to provide evidence for all of the examples in a competency?

No. Examples are illustrative, and it's possible to meet a competency in a different way. This is covered in the ["how to use the competencies" guide](/competencies/how-to-use/).

## Who does this framework apply to?

People that report in to the CTO should use this framework. There are some people in the CTO organisation who are exempt at present as their jobs were sufficiently different to the rest of the CTO team that we felt they should not be included.

Excluded teams are:

* Global Service Desk
* Operations teams in O&R
* Cyber Security risk and compliance
* Digital print team
* Finance systems
* Salesforce admins

Engineers at the FT that do not report in the the CTO may also find this framework useful and are free to use it.

## Are competencies weighted / are some competencies more important than others?

No, competencies are not weighted. No competency is more important than any other for an engineer's progression.
