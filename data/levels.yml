    Mid level engineers should be proficient in the technical systems
    that they are working on. They should be aware and guided by the wider
    context of their work. They should take responsibility for their work
    and own their personal development. They should be working as part of
    a team to achieve the shared goals of the team.

    Senior 1 (S1) engineers are expected to improve the performance of those around
    them. This could be through additional official responsibilities such
    as line managing or tech leading, or through unofficial means such as
    mentoring or regular pairing. S1 engineers should be able to tackle
    more complicated technical problems, and explain and justify their
    approaches to their team. We expect S1 engineers to pick up work
    outside of their delivery team and manage that work effectively
    against their delivery teamâ€™s priorities. S1 engineers require very little
    oversight beyond high level direction.

  summary: >
    The Senior 2 (S2) engineer exhibits leadership and influence well beyond themselves.
    This influence could be through tech leading, line managing, mentoring, or leading
    projects outside of their day-to-day work. Senior 2 engineers are good at
    seeing ill-defined or difficult projects through to completion. They are great at
    spotting issues and helping their team navigate them. Senior 2 engineers have a deep
    understanding and willingness to help others for a particular technology or product.
